## Print Instructions 
You need 2X Frames and 1X base Plate.

* Min bed size 250x250mm (printed on a Bambu P1S).
* Material: The reference files are printed with ASA Filaments (more durable and easier to print than ABS) but PLA or other materials works just fine.
* Supports set to Tree: Auto. 

Recommended orientation:

## Assembly 

1. Print 2X Frames and 1X base plates 
2. Cut 3x metal rods to 10.25in (260mm) Lineman Pliers work well for cutting, but will requre filing on the ends to ensure the nuts fit (yes we know that is a rusty wood file)

3. Insert threaded rods with washer and and screw nuts onto the bottom side holes

4. Slide the base plate on, followed by the other Frame piece

5. Add washers and screw nuts, tighten down until the frame does not wiggle

6. Optional: you can add another threaded rod to the top rear of the rack for added strength
7. Optional: Add 4x adhesive Rubber Bumbers to the feet for a luxurious feel. Leave out if you are attaching the extender
8. Optional: Add M3x4x5 Heat set inserts with a dsoldering iron to support M3x6 metal thumb screws. If not use plastic self tapping screws (#8 worked for us in the US).  Highly recommend fun colored thumb screws:
